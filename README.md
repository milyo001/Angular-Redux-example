# Angular-Redux-example
## An example project build with Angular using the Ngrx library. 
## The idea is to keep all angular application data in a single javascript object which gives you a predictable global data state at any given point of time.
## An important thing is that the state is immutable, so it has to be copied to a whole new state.

# How to run on local machine
- Clone/download this repository
- Run the code below 
```
npm install
yarn install (if you are using Yarn package manager)
```
- Start the angular application in development mode(optional: --open command will open the browser once the application is build)
```
ng serve --open
```
